Note: there are TODOs in code as well

Figure out how to make tests utilizing tor process run with CI(is this possible?)
At least create a docker container so testing with tor is reasonably predictable

Migrate away from openssl for v2 key (de)serialization. Something more lightweight would be better.

Cleanup pub(crate) for fuzzing functions. Create modules exporting fuzzing stuff and then reexport them in src/fuzz.rs
